- likely_false_positive: the detector's literal factual claim is probably wrong; use this only when the supplied evidence suggests the detected condition itself is not actually present
- no_material_impact: the condition is definitely present, but the supplied context indicates no meaningful practical consequence on this page
- low_impact: the condition is definitely present and has a limited practical consequence
- context_dependent: the condition is present, but its consequence materially depends on page/site context that cannot be resolved confidently from the supplied evidence
- meaningful_issue: the condition is present and the supplied evidence supports a meaningful consequence worth action within the configured consequence profile
- manual_review: the evidence is insufficient to determine either the condition or its consequence reliably

IMPORTANT:
- Return all required fields: judgement, confidence, rationale, evidence_used, item_assessments, useful_context.
- First answer the factual question: does the supplied deterministic evidence establish that the detector's literal condition exists?
- If yes, likely_false_positive is not an allowed interpretation. A real-but-benign condition is no_material_impact, not a false positive.
- A stylistic, semantic or best-practice disagreement does not make a detector false positive when its literal condition is present.
- Inspect SPECIFIC AFFECTED EVIDENCE first.
- Do not base the judgement mainly on aggregate page counts.
- The consequence profile gives the permitted impact framing and baseline priority. Do not promote an issue above that baseline merely because it is real.
- evidence_used must identify concrete supplied evidence, not generic SEO principles. Return no more than 6 evidence_used items.
- If the evidence contains an examples array, assess every supplied example individually in item_assessments using the same judgement labels.

Write the summary as a useful synthesis:
- lead with the meaningful change, not the data structure
- combine related facts into one clear explanation rather than listing every status, boolean or field
- mention technical details only when they materially help explain what changed
- where relevant, contrast the practical server-HTML and rendered behaviour in plain English
- for link destination changes, prioritise destination outcome: whether each URL works, whether they resolve to the same final URL, and whether their declared canonicals overlap
- if two different hrefs converge on the same final URL or canonical destination, say that explicitly because it materially changes how the difference should be understood
- only mention zone, component or nearby DOM context when it genuinely helps identify or explain the changed element
- use surrounding content to make the explanation intelligible, but do not invent meaning that is not supplied
- preserve genuine uncertainty where it matters

- merely restate every supplied fact
- describe an unchanged anchor as changed, or an href as anchor text

Rules:
- do not infer page scope, hierarchy or intent from URL folder names alone
- a different href that resolves to the same final URL can still be a link_destination change without being an important discovery problem
- use anchor_context for anchor-text-only changes when the destination and availability are unchanged
- if a working link is unavailable in server HTML but available after rendering, that rendering dependency is relevant when judging the destination change

  falsePositiveGuidance: {
    h1_presence: `A missing H1 is not automatically a serious problem if the page's main topic is still clearly expressed through other prominent headings or page structure. It is more concerning when the page lacks any clear primary heading or topic signal.`,

    multiple_h1: `Multiple H1s are not automatically harmful. They are more likely to be harmless when additional H1s come from templates, components, modals, recommendations, cookie UI or clearly secondary page regions. They are more concerning when several visible, topically important H1s compete to represent the main page topic.`,

    title_presence: `A missing title is generally a meaningful issue on an indexable page intended for search. It may be less meaningful on utility, internal, transient, or intentionally non-indexable pages.`,

    title_length: `A long title is not automatically a problem. Treat it as likely harmless when the primary topic or target phrase is clear and front-loaded, especially if the extra length comes from useful modifiers or branding. Treat it as more problematic when the title is vague, repetitive, unfocused, keyword-stuffed, or buries or omits the main topic. A short title is more concerning when it fails to describe the page clearly, but can be acceptable when the page topic is inherently concise and unambiguous.`,

    meta_description_presence: `A missing meta description is more meaningful on important indexable landing pages where a concise search snippet would be useful. It may be less meaningful on utility pages, dynamically generated pages, or pages where search engines are likely to construct a better snippet from the content.`,

    meta_description_length: `A long meta description is not automatically a problem. Prioritise whether it clearly communicates the page topic and value proposition early. Extra relevant detail is usually harmless. Treat it as more problematic when it is repetitive, generic, unfocused, padded, or fails to communicate the page's purpose early.`,

    canonical_presence: `A missing canonical is not automatically harmful when the page is clearly unique and has no realistic duplicate or parameter variants, but it can create ambiguity on duplicate-prone, parameterised, syndicated, paginated, or templated URLs.`,

    multiple_canonical: `Multiple canonical declarations are more concerning when they disagree or point to different targets. Repeated identical canonicals may be redundant but are less likely to create a meaningful indexing problem.`,

    canonical_cross_origin: `A cross-domain canonical can be intentional for syndicated, duplicated, migrated, regional, or otherwise equivalent content. Judge whether the target plausibly represents the preferred equivalent page. It is more concerning when the canonical appears unrelated, mismatched, insecure, on an unexpected environment, or inconsistent with the visible page.`,

    canonical_relationship: `This finding means the canonical target is on the same origin but is not the current URL. The detector's factual claim is only that the non-self same-origin relationship exists. If same_origin=true and self_canonical=false, do not call this a detector error. Query removal can be entirely expected for tracking, sorting, facet or pagination parameters when same_path=true and the canonical points to the clean preferred URL. Query addition or a path change needs more scrutiny. Use the supplied relation fields and page context to judge whether the target plausibly represents an equivalent preferred URL. Do not invent the reason the canonical was chosen.`,

    rendered_head_invalid_element: `This check establishes only that a non-head-valid element is present as a child of the rendered DOM <head>. Use the supplied tag, markup, position, nearby elements, critical metadata after it, and possible_implication. Do not claim this proves source-HTML parser termination or displaced metadata because JavaScript may have inserted the element after parsing. Source-head parser disruption is a separate concern and requires source-head evidence.`,

    robots_noindex: `Noindex can be intentional for utility, search, filter, account, cart, duplicate, staging, temporary, or otherwise non-search-facing pages. It is more concerning when the page appears unique, useful, index-worthy, and clearly intended to attract organic search traffic.`,

    images_missing_alt: `Missing alt text is only problematic when an image conveys meaningful information that is not otherwise available. Decorative images do not need descriptive alt text. Linked or functional images require more scrutiny because they may need an accessible text alternative.`,

    heading_hierarchy: `Heading hierarchy issues are more meaningful in primary/main content than in navigation, footer, cookie/consent UI or utility components. A skipped heading level is not automatically harmful if the visual/semantic structure remains clear, but repeated or topically important hierarchy jumps can make page structure harder to interpret.`,

    html_lang_presence: `A missing HTML lang attribute is primarily an accessibility and language-identification issue. It is more important on multilingual/international sites and when other locale signals are present.`,

    html_lang_format: `The HTML lang value should be a plausible BCP-47-style language/locale value. Minor casing differences are usually harmless; malformed or unrelated values are more concerning.`,

    robots_conflict: `Conflicting robots meta directives are genuinely risky because different declarations can send contradictory index/follow instructions. Treat explicit index/noindex or follow/nofollow conflicts as important.`,

    canonical_fragment: `Canonical URLs normally identify a document URL rather than a fragment. A fragment on a canonical is usually suspicious unless there is a very unusual, deliberate implementation.`,

    canonical_protocol_downgrade: `An HTTPS page canonicalising to HTTP is usually suspicious and can create inconsistent preferred-URL signals. It may be intentional only in unusual legacy setups.`,

    jsonld_parse_error: `Invalid JSON-LD is meaningful when structured data is intended to be consumed. A syntax error can prevent part or all of the block being parsed.`,

    hreflang_duplicate_value: `Multiple hreflang declarations for the same language/locale are suspicious when they point to different URLs. Exact duplicate declarations are redundant but less serious.`,

    hreflang_unapproved_value: `This check is about project policy, not hreflang syntax, and should contain only syntactically valid hreflang values. A malformed value belongs under hreflang_invalid_format instead. Bare language entries in the allow-list permit valid language-family variants (for example es allows es-ES/es-MX; zh allows zh-Hans/zh-Hant). Specific locale entries remain specific. Treat an out-of-policy value as an implementation-consistency finding and use the supplied allow-list evidence rather than inventing a locale strategy.`,

    hreflang_invalid_format: `Malformed hreflang values can prevent language/region targeting from being interpreted as intended. x-default is valid; language and optional region/script subtags should otherwise be plausible.`,

    hreflang_empty_href: `A hreflang declaration without a usable target URL cannot serve its purpose and is likely a real implementation issue.`,

    open_graph_incomplete: `Open Graph metadata is not a direct ranking requirement, but partial implementations can create poor or inconsistent social previews. Treat it as lower SEO severity than indexation or canonical issues.`,

    og_url_mismatch: `An og:url value can legitimately differ in some sharing setups, but it should usually represent the same preferred page identity as the canonical/current URL. Unexpected hosts, protocols or environments are more concerning.`,

    twitter_card_incomplete: `Twitter/X card metadata is not a direct ranking requirement. A partial implementation is mainly a social-sharing quality issue rather than a core SEO defect.`,

    favicon_presence: `A missing favicon is primarily a UX/browser-branding issue rather than a material organic-search defect. Treat it as low severity unless the project explicitly requires it.`,

    images_empty_alt: `An empty alt attribute can be correct for decorative images. It is only problematic when the image conveys meaningful or functional information that is not otherwise represented.`,

    images_missing_dimensions: `Missing width/height attributes can contribute to layout instability when dimensions are not otherwise reserved by CSS or aspect-ratio. Do not assume the absence of attributes alone proves CLS impact.`,

    links_empty_anchor: `Judge each supplied empty-anchor example, not empty links in the abstract. For every example inspect its href/rawHref, selector, zone/component, visible_on_page, nearby_text, child_tags and image/SVG signals. Your evidence_used must mention at least one specific supplied href or selector when examples are present. Do not use the total internal-link count as evidence that an empty anchor is good or bad, and do not infer that a link is navigational merely because the page has many internal links. A visible link to a meaningful destination with no visible or accessible name is more likely to be a real issue. Hidden/template/placeholder anchors, empty hash targets, or non-user-facing implementation artefacts may be lower concern or false positives. An icon/image link is still concerning when it genuinely has no accessible text alternative. If an individual example cannot be understood from the supplied fields, mark that example manual_review rather than generalising.`,

    internal_http_links: `Internal HTTP links on an HTTPS page are usually undesirable when an HTTPS equivalent exists, because they can introduce redirects or inconsistent secure URL references.`,

    viewport_presence: `A missing viewport meta tag is more likely to be a meaningful issue on modern responsive/mobile pages. It may be less relevant in unusual embedded, legacy, or deliberately fixed-width contexts, though those cases are uncommon.`
